Our game is similar to Crazy Arcade but simpler.
In the game, the player can control the character with arrow keys for directions, and space key for setting water bombs. The character can have a maximum of 5 water bombs each time. The water bomb will be blowd after few seconds, and will destroy breakable wooden boxes and hurt character and enemies within the range, which is shaped like "+". Also, character would also be damaged if it collides with enemies.

To win this game, the player have to control the character and use water bombs to kill the enemies.

How we satisfied the requirements:
1. We have many 3D objects in this game: Ground, Water Column, Wooden Boxes, Bricks, Character, Enemies, Water Bombs. The position of the camera is fixed, the camera looks at the map from above, but the view is not a flat view, because we also move the camera along the z axis, which shows more details of our game.
